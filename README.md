# COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-rays 🚀🔍


## Overview

Welcome to the COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-rays project! This repository contains a comprehensive solution for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art methods to enhance, preprocess, and extract features from X-ray images, followed by the application of various machine learning models to accurately classify the images as COVID-positive or COVID-negative.

## Features ✨

- **Image Visualization**: Display and compare COVID and Non-COVID X-ray images.
- **Image Enhancement**: Improve image quality using histogram equalization.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and augment images for better model performance.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract meaningful features using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models including SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for future use.
